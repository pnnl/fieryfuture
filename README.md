# Deep Learning Classification of Cheatgrass Invasion

## Abstract
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion is driving an emerging cycle of increased fire frequency and irreversible loss of wildlife habitat in the western US. Yet, detailed spatial information about its occurrence is still lacking for much of its presumably invaded range. Here, we provide code and training data used to develop Deep Neural Network, Joint Recurrent Neural Network, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models  presented in Larson and Tuor (2021; see *Associated Publication*). Resultant maps produced from the best performing model are also included.
